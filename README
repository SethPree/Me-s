MeÃ¼s: The game of exacting googling. 

Constraints:
Players -> Up to about 7 billion. 
Queries -> Up to 100 per diem.
  I suggest we develop a simple search crawler that strips the result count from google directly.
  this way we could garner a few more searches.
Combinations -> Up to 301 100 choose 2 = 45 330 454 450 (if the OED provides the deck)
Possible Results -> 1 000 000 000 000, roughly. 


The Rules of the Game:
1. Each player is given a deck of words (size TBD)
2. Each play is given a collection of random numbers between 1 and one trillion.
3. Each play has (CONSTRAINT) to produce pairs of words from his or her deck in order to produce the vector of two-word-search that comes closest to the vector of random numbers mentioned in RULE 2.
